## Why Paystack for this catalogue

Mobile money, bank transfer and cards, settled in cedis or naira into a local
account. The catch is that **Paystack takes the money but does not host files** —
delivery is this repository's webhook, which is why the setup below matters more
than the copy does.

## Product setup

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Product | AI Appointment Booking System |
| Price (GHS) | GHS 1,540 |
| Price (NGN) | NGN 191,000 |
| Quantity | Unlimited |
| Success message | See below |

**Product name** — 29/100 characters

```
AI Appointment Booking System
```

**Description** — 494/500 characters

```
A timezone-correct availability engine, the agent's prompt and tools generated from your own services and policies, and a simulator that books against the real engine.

• Agents that hallucinate availability because nothing constrains them
• Timezone arithmetic done in the prompt, which is where it goes wrong
• Prompts, tool definitions and customer messages drifting out of agreement

Instant download after payment. 14-day refund, no questions asked. Reply to your receipt and say the word.

| Agency licence | GHS 3,070 | NGN 380,000 |

## Metadata — this is what makes delivery work

On the payment page or product, add custom fields so the webhook knows what was
bought:

```json
{
  "product_slug": "appointment-booking",
  "tier": "studio"
}
```

If you cannot set metadata on a storefront product, name the Paystack product
**exactly** `AI Appointment Booking System` or exactly `appointment-booking`. The webhook matches on
either, exactly — it will not guess at a near match, because the products in
this catalogue differ by a word in places and sending the wrong one to a paying
customer is worse than a webhook that fails and tells you.

## Webhook

Dashboard → Settings → API Keys & Webhooks → Webhook URL:

```
https://paystack.shop/mosh-digital-studios/api/webhooks/paystack
```

The route verifies the `x-paystack-signature` HMAC-SHA512 against your secret
key on the raw body, ignores anything that is not `charge.success`, and
re-verifies the transaction against Paystack's API before issuing a link.
A duplicate delivery of the same reference does not issue a second grant.
