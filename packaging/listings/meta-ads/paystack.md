## Why Paystack for this catalogue

Mobile money, bank transfer and cards, settled in cedis or naira into a local
account. The catch is that **Paystack takes the money but does not host files** —
delivery is this repository's webhook, which is why the setup below matters more
than the copy does.

## Product setup

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Product | Meta Ads & Pixel Blueprints |
| Price (GHS) | GHS 1,540 |
| Price (NGN) | NGN 191,000 |
| Quantity | Unlimited |
| Success message | See below |

**Product name** — 27/100 characters

```
Meta Ads & Pixel Blueprints
```

**Description** — 447/500 characters

```
The tracking code, the event map, the campaign structure — and the arithmetic that decides whether any of it can work at the budget you actually have.

• Spending a budget too small to exit the learning phase
• A Pixel installed but no event map, so nothing is optimisable
• Campaign structures copied from a video with different economics

## Pricing across tiers

Paystack storefront products carry one price. Create three products — one per
licence — or sell the Studio licence here and handle upgrades by email.

| Licence | GHS | NGN |
|---|---|---|
| Solo licence | GHS 620 | NGN 76,000 |
| Studio licence | GHS 1,540 | NGN 191,000 |
| Agency licence | GHS 3,070 | NGN 380,000 |

## Metadata — this is what makes delivery work

On the payment page or product, add custom fields so the webhook knows what was
bought:

```json
{
  "product_slug": "meta-ads",
  "tier": "studio"
}
```

If you cannot set metadata on a storefront product, name the Paystack product
**exactly** `Meta Ads & Pixel Blueprints` or exactly `meta-ads`. The webhook matches on
either, exactly — it will not guess at a near match, because the products in
this catalogue differ by a word in places and sending the wrong one to a paying
customer is worse than a webhook that fails and tells you.

## Webhook

Dashboard → Settings → API Keys & Webhooks → Webhook URL:

```
https://REPLACE-ME.example.com/api/webhooks/paystack
```

The route verifies the `x-paystack-signature` HMAC-SHA512 against your secret
key on the raw body, ignores anything that is not `charge.success`, and
re-verifies the transaction against Paystack's API before issuing a link.
A duplicate delivery of the same reference does not issue a second grant.
